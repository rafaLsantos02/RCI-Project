This was do during the frequency in the curricular unit, CNI (Computers Networks and Internet), in collaboration with a college friend (@gfirme).

The main goal of this project was to creat kind of internet to transmit messages from one application to other, that is, one applications that when in group with various of this application, create a ring and can communicate with each others. 
The application have some functionalites such as:
  1. Can communicate with the main server via UDP to find which aplications already exists in the ring (this main server, is a server created by the professors of this curricular unit).
  2. Can communicate with other applications via TCP, that is, the application needs to be server and client TCP as client UDP.
  3. Can receive commands from the terminal writtings by User.
  4. Can stabilish the topology layer of neighbors with sucess, i.e., with the previous and next application.
  5. Can stabilish cords with other application that are not is directly neighborhoods.
  6. Can transmit messages with the maximum of 128 characters.
  7. Can calculate the minium path to transmit the messages between applications.
